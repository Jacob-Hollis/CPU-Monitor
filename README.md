# CPU Monitor

A project I built for CS 3330.
The IDE I used was Netbeans, along with Scene Builder for FXML editing. 

It can calculate real time CPU usage, memory usage, and total disk space used (on the same drive as the application).

CPU usage guage is smoother on OSX systems, the animation is stuttery in Windows 10 machines.
